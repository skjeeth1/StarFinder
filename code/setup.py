FINDER_DATA = {
    "Reading the Wobble": "This method involves making precise measurements of a star's position to detect the tiny wobble caused by an orbiting planet.",
    "Dips in Light": "When a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks some of the star's light, which creates a small decrease in the observed light. The depth of the decrease is proportional to the planet's cross-section",
    "Reading the Light": "It's a technique known as 'transit spectroscopy,' when light from a star travels through the atmosphere of an orbiting planet and reaches our telescopes – in space or on the ground – and tells about where it's been.",
    "Direct Imaging": "This method captures pictures of exoplanets orbiting distant stars. It's very difficult to do, but it provides scientists with a lot of data about the planet, including its orbit and atmosphere."
