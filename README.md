We the members of Webb the Universe, Srikrishna Sathyajeeth and Anand P Nair, developed a python game that helps young minds to discover more about the existence of exoplanets.
This game aims to address the issue with learning, that is, boredom.
This game provides a fun interactive experience to keep the learner interested throughout the experience.
We hope  to expose more children to this field as this is the future.
We mainly used Python (Pycharm and Spyder(anaconda3) and some websites to get assets. 
In terms of hardware it was all coded on laptops.

This game also has a minigame "Space Invaders". Which is linked to the game storyline
which is given below

LORE OF THE GAME: 
You are a military sergeant tasked with retrieving the AI information libraries
that were stolen by the space invaders.
To do this you fend off the space invaders in the process unlock clues to find 
out where they might've come from. Once you get enough clues you can set off on a 
voyage to their planet and complete your mission.
